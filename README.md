1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   The project aimed to develop an interactive system for a partnership between Airgead Banking and a local high school. The system focused on teaching students the concepts of fiscal responsibility, specifically the power of compound interest and the importance of investing. The application allowed users to input their principal amount, interest rate, and time period, and then provided them with a summary of how their investments would grow over time. By demonstrating the potential growth of investments through compound interest, the project aimed to promote financial literacy and encourage students to make informed decisions about saving and investing.
   
2) What did you do particularly well?
  I was able to create the code and have it run the exact output as expected. 
  
3) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   Several areas for enhancing the code can lead to improved efficiency, security, and overall quality. First, implementing input validation can ensure that only valid data is accepted, preventing potential errors or unexpected behavior. Exception handling can be added to gracefully handle runtime errors, making the code more robust and secure. Additionally, incorporating modular and reusable functions promotes code reusability, readability, and maintainability. Proper documentation and comments throughout the code can enhance its understandability for future developers. Implementing unit tests can validate the correctness of individual components, improving code reliability. Finally, optimizing performance-critical sections and considering security measures such as input sanitization and secure data storage can further enhance the efficiency and security of the codebase.
     
4)Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I had a few challenges when writing this code, as I recall there were a few instances where I needed help with my wording and my syntax, after receiving that help I was able to write the code and have it run without errors. I feel one of my biggest struggles is debugging, I need to debug as I go instead of waiting until I am finished and having a large number of bugs. 

5)What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The transferable skills from this project include:
1. Object-oriented programming principles, such as encapsulation and inheritance, which can be applied to projects in various programming languages.
2. Designing functional programs that adhere to industry regulations and best practices, ensuring code quality and compliance.
3. Problem-solving and critical thinking skills when developing solutions for specific requirements.
4. Testing and debugging techniques to identify and fix issues, improving code robustness and quality.
5. Understanding of financial concepts like compound interest, which can be applicable to other finance-related projects or coursework.

6)How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability of the program, key practices were followed. The code was designed with modular functions, employing descriptive naming conventions and proper indentation for readability. In-line comments were used to clarify code logic and intentions. Error handling and input validation were implemented to prevent issues and enhance reliability. The separation of concerns was applied to isolate specific functionalities, and object-oriented programming principles aided in encapsulation and abstraction. By adhering to these practices, the program becomes easier to understand, modify, and maintain, while also allowing for adaptability to future changes or additions.
